# Week 19: Progressive Web App Text Editor

## Description

For the 19th week in our coding bootcamp we were tasked with configuring a webpack file along with a service worker for a partially complete web based text editor. We were to utilize Webpack and a number of its plugins to bundle a development build into something much more condensed, and these packaged files were to be cached at the user's request using an InjectManifest service worker. Finally, the actual content of the text editor was stored using IndexedDB.

## Installation

Application already to deployed to Heroku [here.](https://fathomless-ocean-60654.herokuapp.com/)

To download the project for testing or reference, run `npm install` in the root folder once the repo is cloned to your machine. To begin hosting the app at `localhost:3000` (3000 being the default port defined in `./server/server.js`) run `npm run start` to both build and spool up the local server. For a full list of availible npm commands, view the `./package.json` dev commands.
